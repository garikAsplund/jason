				Toska Bear is the alter ego of Columbus-based musician Jason Porter. Toska Bear blends
				elements of indie pop, synthwave, EDM, hip-hop, indie rock, and vaporwave.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Year of the Beard</em> is his debut album, and is heavily inspired by gay culture, videogames,
				underground music, and focuses on themes of aging, changing, and time passing.
			</p>
			<p>
				His second album, <em>Taking My Mind For A Ride</em>, was released in 2022 and tackles the
				creeping existential dread one faces as they approach middle age, from the perspective of
				somebody who is floating out in space.
