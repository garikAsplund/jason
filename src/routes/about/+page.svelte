			Toska Bear is the alter ego of Columbus, Ohio based musician Jason Porter. Toska Bear blends
			elements of indie pop, synthwave, EDM, hip-hop, indie rock, and vaporwave. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Year of the Beard</em> is his debut album, and is heavily inspired by gay culture, videogames, underground
			music, and focuses on themes of aging, changing, and time passing.
		</p>
		<p>
			His second album, <em>Taking My Mind For A Ride</em>, was released in 2022 and tackles the creeping existential
			dread one faces as they approach middle age, from the perspective of somebody who is floating
			out in space.
